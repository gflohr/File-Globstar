0.5  2017-12-03
    - removed Pod::Coverage::TrustPod and Test::Perl::Critic as test
      requirements as they are only needed for author tests

0.4  2017-12-02
    - "/**" is not truly optional
    - trailing "dir/**" not matches "dir/inside" and "dir/" and "dir"; this

    - run author tests on Travis CI

    - new function pnmatchstar()
    - minor bug fixes for edge cases
